However, from February 2021 to March 2021, there is a sudden increase of 1.2%. Overall, the Aluminum price remains relatively stable with small fluctuations throughout the period.\n",
      "- The Banana price in Europe exhibits a decreasing trend from October 2020 to August 2021, with a decrease of 7.7%. From August 2021 to October 2021, there is a slight increase of 2.2%. From October 2021 to November 2021, there is a significant increase of 5.9%, followed by a steady increase until March 2023. The Banana price shows a strong upward trend, with an overall increase of 31.6%.\n",
      "- Both Aluminum and Banana prices show seasonality, with similar patterns repeating each year. The lowest Aluminum prices occur in February, while the highest prices occur in December. For Banana prices, the lowest prices occur in July, and the highest prices occur in March.\n",
      "- An anomaly can be observed in the Aluminum price between February 2021 and March 2021, where there is a sudden increase of 1.2% after a period of decreasing prices. This anomaly could be due to external factors such as changes in supply and demand or market dynamics.\n",
      "- Another anomaly can be observed in the Banana price between October 2021 and November 2021, where there is a significant increase of 5.9% within a month. This anomaly could be attributed to factors such as changes in import/export regulations, weather conditions affecting production, or shifts in consumer demand.\n",
      "- The difference between the highest and lowest Aluminum prices within the given time period is 12.2%, indicating relatively low volatility in the Aluminum market.\n",
      "- In contrast, the difference between the highest and lowest Banana prices is 39.4%, suggesting higher volatility in the Banana market.\n",
      "- The average monthly change in Aluminum prices is -0.4%, indicating a slight downward trend over the analyzed period.\n",
      "- On the other hand, the average monthly change in Banana prices is 1.3%, demonstrating a strong upward trend.\n",
